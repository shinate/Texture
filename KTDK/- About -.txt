This is the Kemono texture development kit, here you will find everything you need to create your own Kemono texture mods.

The "TDK combined - layered.cxf/psd" files for photchop and gimp, have the head, body and tail textures on a single page, this makes it easier to work with and match colors of each body part. 
When you are done with your mod, cut it up back and save it into 3 separate images, head 1024x1024, body 512x1024 and tail 512x512.
